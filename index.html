        <p>Daves Creek Elementary opened in 1996, but the building was not occupied by students until January, 1997. Ms. Marian Hicks was the first principal and the school was built to accommodate the overcrowding at Mashburn and Big Creek elementary schools. Daves Creek Elementary is named after the former Daves Creek School, which was named for the Daves Creek Mill. The grist mill exists today but is not active. Adjacent to the school campus is Joint Venture Park. The park opened in 2006 and is a partnership between the Forsyth County Board of Education and the Forsyth County Commissioners.</p>

At the Daves Creek Media Center we are proud of our collection of over 25,000 books, far surpassing the American Library Association standard of 10 books per student. We have a state of the art, networked computer system which enables students, staff, and parents access to our library catalog, Destiny, PebbleGo, GALILEO, and other curriculum-based programs.
 
Our media staff provides continuous educational instruction for both students and faculty. Students begin the year with a basic library orientation, followed by training on Destiny and reference materials. Collaboration with the classroom teachers to support instructional needs is ongoing. Our Media Center operates on a flexible schedule which allows students to visit anytime during the day.
Don't forget our wonderful local library online. </p>
